# Design_Patterns
To really understand something, you have to do it yourself.
This is my way of learning "Design Patterns" with coded examples.

## With the books 
1. [Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3A94LRZ50OFJO&keywords=design+patterns+elements+of+reusable+object-oriented+software&qid=1678180381&sprefix=design+patterns%2Caps%2C189&sr=8-1) 
2. [Head First Desing Pattners - Building Extensible & Maintainable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented/dp/149207800X/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2TYWPSCGD8YS9&keywords=Head+first+design+patterns+elements+of+reusable+object-oriented+software&qid=1678180424&sprefix=head+first+design+patterns+elements+of+reusable+object-oriented+software%2Caps%2C163&sr=8-2)

## The one contant in software development
  CHANGE
  
No matter how well you design an application, over time an application must grow and change or it will die.
